# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based voting platform that allows transparent and tamper-proof elections. Each participant can cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, and results are publicly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Vision

## Key Features
- Voter authentication using wallet addresses.
- Transparent and immutable record of all votes.
- Automatic vote tallying and winner declaration.
- Owner-controlled start and end of the election.

## Future Scope
- Integration with Chainlink VRF for random audits.
- Implementation of voter registration and eligibility verification.
- Development of a web-based DApp frontend using React and Web3.js.
- Enabling multiple elections with different candidates and time limits.
